# What is this?
This builds on the work at https://css-tricks.com/examples/ResponsiveTables/responsive.php. The linked example is a responsive table that snaps to displaying all columns as lists at certain media query points. I don't need the responsive element but I do need the list displaying capability.

The project I'm using it in has wide tables with some cells that contain a lot of text. I also use the https://github.com/kollavarsham/ng-table-to-csv module to export tables as CSV so it's important that the markup of the table it "correct" so the CSV gets created correctly.

The hacked up example above has some cells displayed as columns and the rest displayed in a list format. The responsive element is gone.

# License?
Seeing as the inspiration came from CSS Tricks, I'll use the same license https://css-tricks.com/license/ for this work.
